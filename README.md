# Sentiment Analyzer for Top Google News Articles

Sentiment Analysis is a Python program which utilizes pygooglenews, bs4, requests, vaderSentiment and pandas to extract the top 100 articles from google news, analyze their sentiment scores using natural language processing and visualizes the top negative and postitive articles under each search. 

## Motivation
I created this project to keep track of the 2024 presidential election and the sentiment of top news articles with each new development like Joe Biden dropping out of the race, but the program works with any search with the context of any country. 

## Example Use Case
An example use case is comparing the sentiments of articles from the 2024 US Second Presidential Debate.
